# 1. Dynamic Address Book 
  - Options:
      - **Add_contact :**
      
            Take input Contact_name, Contact_email, Contact_phone. Stored in pickle file.
      - **Display_contact :**
            
            If the file is not empty then Display all contact . else print “No contact in address book”.
      - **Delete_contact :**
            
            Take input name of the contact to be deleted If contact exist then it deletes all details of particular contact Else 
            print “No contact with this name”.
      - **Modify_contact :**
            
            Take the input name of the contact to be modified.If contact exists then it modifies the contact content.After 
            modification print the “Contact modified”,if contact is not found in file then print message “No contact with this name 
            found”, If the contact book is empty then print message "Address book empty. No contact to delete" .
      - **Seach_contact :**
            
            Take the input name of the contact to be deleted. If contact exists then search the contact content, if contact found 
            display it, else print error message.

# 2. Menu Calculator
      
      We wrote this program to make it easier to takeand calculate orders. Since our sample restaurant only sells 5 different items,
      you assign each one to a number, as shown below.To quickly take orders, your program  allow the user to type in a string of 
      numbers and then it calculate the cost of the order. the program loops so the user can take multiple orders without having to
      restart the program each time.

# 3. Fruit Classifier
      
      We had trained a classifier to distinguish between different types of fruits using K-Nearest Neighbour and Logistic Regression.
      We visualize training data and classified data using matplotlib. Dataset used contains fruit_label, fruit_name, fruit_subtype 
      mass, width, height, color_score.
      
# 4. Diabetes Predictor

      We have to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features given in the dataset. We visualize the 
      training data and classified data using matplotlib. Dataset contains Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin,
      BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome .
